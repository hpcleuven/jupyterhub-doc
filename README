# JupyterHub user documentation

The master branch is deployed at https://hpcleuven.github.io/jupyterhub-doc/
using Github Pages.

To locally render the documentation, you will need Jekyll and Bundler.
One way to install the required dependencies is to create a Conda environment
from the supplied YAML file:

~$ cd jupyterhub-doc
~$ conda env create -f ./environment.yml -n hyde
~$ conda activate hyde
~$ gem install bundler

and for the additional GEMs:

~$ cd jupyterhub-doc
~$ bundle install

The Jekyll server can then be launched as follows:

~$ bundle exec jekyll serve
