## Welcome to the JupyterHub service documentation!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The JupyterHub service has been shut down on 31/03/2023. It has been replaced by [OnDemand](
https://ondemand.hpc.kuleuven.be) which also allows to run Jupyter notebooks on our HPC clusters.
The kernels that you were using before are also available in OnDemand.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This website describes how KU Leuven users may employ the JupyterHub service.

If you have an active VSC account, have a look at the [Getting started](
./getting_started) page. Also the [What is Jupyter](
https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)
page from the Jupyter Notebook beginner guide can be helpful.
