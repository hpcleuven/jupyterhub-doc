## Welcome to the JupyterHub service documentation!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The jupyterhub service will be shutdown on 31/3/2023 and will be replaced by https://ondemand.hpc.kuleuven.be
openOndemand offers the posibility to run jupyternotebooks on our HPC clusters. The kernals that you are using now, will also be available in opDemand.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This website describes how KU Leuven users may employ the JupyterHub service.

If you have an active VSC account, have a look at the [Getting started](
./getting_started) page. Also the [What is Jupyter](
https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)
page from the Jupyter Notebook beginner guide can be helpful.
